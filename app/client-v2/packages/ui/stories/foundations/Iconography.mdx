# Iconography

Using system icons can improve our products by visually conveying actions, status, content, or concepts.
It is important to use icons purposefully in order to promote clarity and reduce the amount of cognitive effort required to understand our products.

Design system icons are sourced from [Material Design](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline)
