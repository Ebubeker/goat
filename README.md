## Feature/EX-TRA branch

In this branch, the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/sv/homepage/) and the [Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI)](https://www.polimi.it/) are developing new features within the [JPI Urban Europe](https://jpi-urbaneurope.eu/project/ex-tra/) project [EX-TRA](https://www.ex-tra-project.eu/). The main innovation is the ‘Inclusive Accessibility by Proximity Index (IAPI)’, which was conceptualized by the partners of POLIMI and technically implemented by TUM. This index aims to evaluate basic accessibility levels to a set of various daily needs and by different active mobility profiles (pedestrians, cyclists, people with reduced mobility)considering the characteristics of the paths affecting walkability and cyclability. Therewith, shortcomings can be identified and potential measures developed (e.g. Street Experiments).
