There are different options of for calculating __catchment areas__. The **buffer** creates a straight line circle, while the **isochrone** calculates the catchment area based on the real transport network. **Single-isochrones** thereby calculate the catchment area of one single starting point, while **multi-isochrones** conduct the analysis for multiple starting points.
