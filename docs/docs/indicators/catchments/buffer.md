# Buffer

The buffer creates a **straight line circle** around a given starting point. Therewith, **catchment areas** can be calculated, e.g. around public transport stops.  


## 1. Explanation

A **buffer** is an simple accessibility indicator that shows the catchment area of a specific point. The buffer ``distance`` can be selected by the user.

In contrary to the [isochrones](isochrones/), which are calculated based on the real transport network, the buffer calculates the catchment areas **as the crow flies**. 

The resulting catchment areas can be intersected with further spatial data sets, such as population and POI data. Therewith it can be assessed how many people or POIs are located within the buffer area.

- How many people live within a 500m distance from the train station? 
- ... TODO ...
