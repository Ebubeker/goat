# Single-Isochrones

Single-Isochrones are **catchment areas** that are **calculated on the real transport network**. This accessibility indicator shows how far a person can travel from a selected starting point within a given travel time.

## 1. Explanation

**Single-Isochrones** show how far a person can travel from a selected starting point within a given travel time. In contrary to the [buffer](buffer/), which creates a straight line circle, the isochrone calculation routes on the real transport network. Therefor, the user can select the ``routing mode`` (_Walking_, _Bike_, _Pedelec_, _Transit_ or _Car_). 

Isochrones can be used as an **accessibility indicator** in one specific location. The isochrone area gives insights into the network connectivity. Furthermore, the isochrone can be intersected with further spatial data sets, such as population and POI data. Therewith it can be assessed how many people or POIs can be reached from a certain starting point.

## 2. Which planning questions can be answered? 

Among others, isochrones can be used to answer the following planning questions:

* How many supermarkets can be reached from a certain point in a 10-minute walk?
* How many people can access a public transport station within 5 minutes of cycling?
* How many people can reach a specific location within 20 minutes by public transport?
* How big is the catchment area of a school by car vs. by public transport? How many students live within these catchment areas? 

## 3. How to use the indicator?

### Step-by-step guideline

1. Pick for which ``routing`` mode you would like to calculate an isochrone. 

TODO: Insert Swizzle (Walking, Cycling/Pedelec, Public Transport, Car)

#### Walking

Considering all paths accessible by foot.

Default walking speed: 5km/h

<img src="https://plan4better.de/images/docs/technical_documentation/isochrone/walking_en.webp" width="1000px" alt="isochrone walking settings" style={{width: "1000px", height: "150px", maxHeight: "100px", maxWidth: "300px", objectFit: "contain"}}/> 

Further information: **TODO: add link to routing/walking**

#### Cycling Standard

Considering all paths accessible by bicycle.

Default cycling speed: 15km/h Depending on the surface, smoothness and slope of the different street segments, the cycling speed is adjusted accordingly (further information: [Publication](/general/publications#accessibility-by-proximity-addressing-the-lack-of-interactive-accessibility-instruments-for-active-mobility) > TODO: check link).

#### Pedelec

Same as the cycling standard profile, but with an increased cycling speed of 23 km/h.
For Pedelecs, slopes are considered with a lower impedance than for standard bicycles.

#### Transit

In this routing mode, users can compute intermodal accessibility centered around public transport. The following settings can be adjusted:

-	The ``weekday`` (Monday to Sunday)
-	Time period (``from time`` and ``to time``) (0h to 24h)
-	``Access Mode`` (How the user accesses the station, e.g., Walk, Bicycle),
-	``Egress Mode`` (How the user exists the station e.g., Walk, Bicycle) 
-	``Transit Modes`` (Bus, Tram, Metro and/or Rail).

How many supermarkets can be reached from a certain point in 10 minutes walking?

##### 1.2 Step-by-Step guide

1. Display all supermarkets by enabling the amenity "Supermarket" in the Thematic Data Filter under the category "Shop".

2. Zoom in into the area where you want to calculate the isochrone.

3. Select the the routing profile and the desired walking speed.

##### 3.2 Step-by-Step guide

1. Set the routing mode to “Transit” and choose the calculation options (weekday, time, access mode and egress mode) as desired. In the “Transit Modes” section, you can select which public transportation options shall be considered for the calculation. In this example, we focus on rail-based public transport (tram, underground and train). To get some additional information on the public transport network, you can activate the public transport background map.

## 4. Technical details

Isochrones are isolines connecting all points that can be reached from a specific starting point within a certain time interval. Depending on the chosen travel mode, the according transport networks are used for the [routing > TODO: Insert Link](/../routing).

The isochrone shapes are dynamically created in the front end based on a travel time grid. Therefore, isochrones can be created fast and for different intervals on the fly.

### Visualization 

The isochrone shape is derived from the routing grid using the [Marching square contour line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares "Wikipedia: Marching Squares"), a computer graphics algorithm that can generate two-dimensional contour lines from a rectangular array of values ([de Queiroz Neto et al. 2016](isochrones#6-resources)). This algorithm transforms the grid from a 2D array to a shape to visualize or analyzed. An illustration of 2D image processing is shown in the figure.
