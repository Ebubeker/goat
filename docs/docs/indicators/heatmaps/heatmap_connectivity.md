# Heatmap - Connectivity

INTRODUCTION / TEASER TEXT (2 sentences, can be used as tooltip in GOAT)

## 1. Explanation

The connectivity heatmap serves as benchmark for the connectivity of the transport infrastructure, i.e. the path network. It can currently be calculated for the walking mode and visualises the connectivity of footpaths on a hexagonal grid. This allows users to identify areas of high and low connectivity in the study area. This is particularly important for the promotion of active modes (walking and cycling), as these modes are sensitive to detours.

The connectivity heatmap is based on the [isochrone](/en/docs/isochrone/ "What is an isochrone?") calculation. From the centroid of each hexagon, the walking catchment area is computed. Based on the size of the catchment area, the hexagons are categorized in <i>very low</i> (**RED**) to <i>very high connectivity</i> (**GREEN**).

Typical areas with low connectivity are along railway lines and large main roads. High connectivity values are often found in residential areas with dense path networks.

## 2. Which planning questions can be answered? 

Among others, the connectivity heatmap can be used to answer the following planning questions:
  - How well is footpath network connected? 
  - Where are connectivity issues? 
  - Where are barriers for pedestrians in the context of street network connectivity?
